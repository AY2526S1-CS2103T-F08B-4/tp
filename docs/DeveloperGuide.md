### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="570" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="480" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Fuzzy Matching ###
The fuzzy command matching feature is designed to improve the user experience by automatically correcting minor typos in command words.
This prevents users from having to re-type a command due to a small mistake.
The implementation is primarily located in the AddressBookParser class.

1. When a user enters a command, the parseCommand(String userInput) method is invoked. It extracts the command word from the input.
2. This command word is then passed to the private helper method fuzzyMatch(String commandWord).

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("addd ...")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the fuzzy matched `addd ...` Command](images/FuzzyMatchSequenceDiagram.png)
3. The fuzzyMatch method leverages the LevenshteinDistance class from the org.apache.commons.text.similarity library. 
   This algorithm measures the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another.
4. A MAX_DIST_THRESHOLD is set to 1, meaning only commands with a Levenshtein distance of 1 from a valid command will be corrected.
5. The method first checks for a direct, case-sensitive match against a predefined list of COMMAND_KEYWORDS.
6. If no exact match is found, it calculates the Levenshtein distance between the user's input and each known command keyword. 
   If it finds a keyword within the distance threshold, that keyword is returned.
7. If no command keyword is found within the threshold, a ParseException is thrown, indicating an unknown command. Moreover, if two command words are of a similar Levenshtein Distance, an Exception is thrown due to the ambiguous command.
8. The corrected command word is then used to select the appropriate parser (e.g., AddCommandParser) to handle the command's arguments.

#### Examples of fuzzy matched commands ####
`Fuzzy Matched Command` -> `Executed Command`
1. `addd` -> `add`
2. `delet` -> `delete`
3. `liss` -> `list`
4. `uattend` / `nattend` -> `Exception Thrown (Ambiguous Command)`

## **Appendix: Effort**

The total effort spent on active development so far is approximately `>=125` hours.
This includes time spent on design, implementation, testing, documentation, and project management activities.

A small part of the implementation of the Fuzzy Search feature was done through an external library.
[This library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/similarity/LevenshteinDistance.html) is from the Apache Commons project and is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### Difficulty level
The difficulty level of this project is considered to be 'Moderate', tending to occasionally 'High' at the earlier stages of development.

This was due to the need to modify the original commands' implementations significantly to fit the new requirements,
which often had a compound effect on other parts of the codebase, and thus was also difficult to segment amongst members.

Furthermore, multiple new object types have been created to represent new complex attributes.
Given that these attributes (Attendance, Grades) are often non-trivial, they required extensive code and tests to ensure their correctness and robustness.

### Challenges faced
Some of the challenges faced during the development of this project include:
* Initial learning process of the codebase, which was very interconnected prior to making any significant changes.
* Selecting design choices that would best fit the new requirements while minimizing the impact on existing functionalities and making future extensions easier.
* Segmenting work effectively among team members, given the interconnected nature of the codebase.

### Achievements
Some of the general achievements of this project include:
* Successful implementation of all core MVP requirements.
* Implementation of additional features such as Fuzzy Search.
* Aesthetic improvements to the UI to utilize more screen space and enhance user experience.
* Enhanced CLI experience through addition of a navigable command history.
