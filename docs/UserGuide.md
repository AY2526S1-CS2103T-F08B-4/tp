CalcConnect allows you to **manage your students’ information on your desktop with keyboard commands**. If you type fast, you can complete your student management tasks faster with CalcConnect than with mouse-based apps. CalcConnect aims to be your **all-in-one tool** to manage the administrative processes of your students. From easily being able to find their contact information to marking their attendance and grading their assignments. Once you familiarise yourself with our intuitive interface, CalcConnect will provide **unparalleled ease** in managing your students.

CalcConnect is designed for **MA1521 TAs** who are technologically inclined. While those familiar with Command Line Interface (CLI) from their previous experience in Computing courses might find it easier to use it, we also have this clear user guide to help those without such previous experience.

## Quick start

1. **Windows** and **Linux** users: Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08B-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the **home folder** for your AddressBook.

1. Go into the folder you put the jar file in, right-click anywhere in the folder space and select **Open in Terminal** (Windows).
   ![OpenInTerminalWindows](images/openCMD.png)

2. For Mac and Linux users, open the Terminal app and use the `cd` command to change the current directory to the folder you put the jar file in.

2. Use the `java -jar CalcConnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com u/@john tg/TG01 t/Smart` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Good Student` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Good Student`, `t/Good Student t/Smart` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Fuzzy Command Matching

The app includes a fuzzy matching feature for commands to enhance user experience. If you make a small typo when entering a command, the application will attempt to match it to the most similar valid command.

This feature uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm with a maximum allowed distance of **1**. This means that commands with a single character difference (insertion, deletion or substitution) from a valid command will be automatically corrected and executed.

Examples:
*   If you type `addd`, it will be interpreted as `add`.
*   If you type `liss`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
*   If you type `eddit`, it will be interpreted as `edit`.
*   If you type `ad`, it will be interpreted as `add`.

However, if the typo is too different from any valid command (a Levenshtein distance greater than 1), you will receive an "unknown command" error.
For instance, `listee` will not be interpreted as `list`.

Warnings:
* If command typo is too different
- Output: `Unknown Command`

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a popup with a help guide of the commands available to users.

![help popup](images/helpPopup.jpg)

### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL u/TELEHANDLE [tg/TUTORIAL_GROUP] [t/TAG]…​`

Warnings:
* If a student with the same name already exists in the address book, an error message will be displayed, and the student will not be added.
  e.g. `This student already exists in the address book`
* If any of the fields contain invalid values (e.g. empty name, phone number with non-numeric characters, improperly formatted email, or telehandle not starting with `@`), an error message will be displayed and the student will not be added.

  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

**Expected Output:**<br>
A list of persons matching your search criteria will be displayed in the main window.

Examples:
* `find John` 
<br>returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david`
<br>returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find n/Alex e/example.com`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/CalcConnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Features coming soon
* Delete multiple students in a single command
* Mark the attendance of multiple students in a single command

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: In the original computer, copy `addressbook.json` in your `data/` folder. Install the app in the other computer, and overwrite the data file it creates in `data/` with the copied file from the original computer.

**Q**: How do I update CalcConnect?<br>
**A**: Download the latest .jar file from the official release page and replace your old version. Do note that your data may not be usable in the new version, and the application will instead boot with an empty address book.

**Q**: Where can I get help or report bugs?<br>
**A**: Contact the development team via [this page](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08b-4.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html), or open an issue on the project’s Github repository.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
